      "Stories by RELFrom 5,000 feet, we look like a media company. If you look close, our greatest strength is producing video. If you find our sweet spot, we are really into agriculture. If you pin us down, we value quality and work hard to deliver as much as we can. If we had a wish, we would be doing this (with an unlimited budget and no deadlines). If you sum us up, we make stories.Produce the story.Every project starts as an idea and ends as a finished product. Producing starts someplace after “idea” and ends when the client is happy with the finished product. Everything in-between is a variable. Our focus is taking that idea and helping our clients get it to an end product they can be proud of.Let’s get our hands dirty.We believe in hard work, but we also believe in working smart. If we have learned anything in nearly 20 years…you need to have processes, technology and workflows…that can be managed and operated efficiently, that are client friendly and are able handle most anything thrown at them. You will understand it when you see it. The tour is free.                                                                                                                                 1\n",
